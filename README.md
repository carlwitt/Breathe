# What?

A simple visual aid for slow breathing. Just breathe while the circle grows and breathe out while the circle shrinks.

A couple of things you might want to check:
1. Do you have stable contact between your feet and the ground?
1. If you're sitting: Do you have contact between your back and the back of the chair?
1. Are your shoulders relaxed? Try to do one circle with your shoulder forwards and one backwards.
1. Are you breathing through your nose?
1. Is the air flowing steadily during exhalation?

# Why?

There's a lot of material that suggests the beneficial effects of breathing slowly through the nose.
I came across it while reading James Nestor's book [1]. 
It cites various sources that inhaling for 5.5 seconds and exhaling for 5.5 seconds has a calming effect.
